# UWB Offline Mesh Communication Standard (UOMCS) - Introduction

## 1. Abstract

This document outlines the UWB Offline Mesh Communication Standard (UOMCS), a framework designed to enable secure, resilient, and internet-independent communication between devices. While UWB (Ultra-Wideband) is a primary target bearer technology for its unique ranging and communication capabilities, UOMCS is architected to be adaptable, potentially operating over or integrating with other communication bearers. The framework facilitates peer-to-peer messaging, data sharing, multi-hop mesh networking, and optional gatewaying to external networks, all with a strong emphasis on security and decentralization.

## 2. Goals

The primary goals of the UOMCS framework **SHALL** be:

- **Connectivity in Disconnected Environments:** To provide reliable communication channels, especially where conventional internet, Wi-Fi, or cellular connectivity is unavailable or unreliable.
- **Security and Privacy by Design:** To embed robust end-to-end encryption, strong authentication, message integrity, and privacy-preserving mechanisms as core tenets of the protocol suite.
- **Resilient Mesh Networking:** To allow devices to form self-healing, ad-hoc networks, enabling data forwarding on behalf of others to extend communication range and improve network robustness.
- **Efficient Data Transfer:** To optimize the transfer of various data types, including text, rich media (voice, images), and precise location data, utilizing the characteristics of the underlying bearer(s).
- **Bearer Agnosticism (Architectural Aim):** While initially focusing on UWB, UOMCS **SHOULD** be designed with modularity that allows for future adaptation to run over other link-layer technologies (e.g., Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct, wired links) or to interface with them for gatewaying.
- **Asynchronous Communication:** To provide mechanisms for both short-term (via mesh queuing) and long-term (e.g., optionally via distributed ledgers or store-and-forward gateways) asynchronous message delivery.
- **Interoperability:** To define clear protocols and data formats that enable devices from different manufacturers to communicate effectively within a UOMCS network.

## 3. Scope

This standard, along with its potential companion profile documents, **SHALL** define the protocols, data formats, interfaces, and procedures for:

- Node identity, peer discovery, and secure ranging (particularly for UWB).
- Secure session establishment and cryptographic key management.
- Data payload formatting, serialization, segmentation, and reassembly.
- A core multi-hop mesh routing protocol.
- Store-and-forward message queuing for transient offline scenarios.
- **OPTIONAL:** Mechanisms for encapsulating and transporting IP packets over UOMCS.
- **OPTIONAL:** Definition of gateway node functionality for connecting a UOMCS mesh to external IP networks (e.g., the Internet).
- **OPTIONAL:** Guidelines and requirements for adapting UOMCS to operate over non-UWB bearer technologies.
- **OPTIONAL:** Interaction with distributed ledgers or other persistent storage for long-term asynchronous messaging.

## 4. Terminology

- **Node:** Any device implementing the UOMCS protocol stack.
- **Peer:** A node that is in direct communication range of another node over a specific bearer.
- **Bearer:** An underlying communication technology used to transmit UOMCS frames between peers (e.g., UWB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi Direct).
- **UOMCS Link:** A logical communication path between two UOMCS peers over a specific bearer, established after successful peer discovery and any necessary bearer-specific connection procedures.
- **UOMCS Session:** A secure, end-to-end encrypted communication context established between two UOMCS nodes, typically after a cryptographic handshake, independent of the underlying bearer(s) used for individual links in a multi-hop path.
- **Mesh:** A network of UOMCS nodes that can communicate with each other directly via UOMCS links or indirectly through packet forwarding by intermediate nodes.
- **Direct Broadcast (Bearer-Specific):** A message transmitted at the Data Link Layer of a specific bearer, intended for all nodes within direct range on that bearer.
- **Meshcast (UOMCS Network Layer):** A UOMCS Network Layer message intended for multiple nodes, potentially all nodes, within the UOMCS mesh, propagated via UOMCS routing and forwarding.
- **NodeID:** A globally unique identifier for a UOMCS node, cryptographically derived from its long-term public key using SHA-256.
- **RREQ (Route Request):** A UOMCS Network Layer control packet used to discover a route to a destination `NodeID`.
- **RREP (Route Reply):** A UOMCS Network Layer control packet used to respond to an `RREQ` and establish a route.
- **RERR (Route Error):** A UOMCS Network Layer control packet used to signal a broken link or unreachable route.
- **Gateway Node (GN):** A UOMCS node that provides a bridge between the UOMCS mesh network and an external network (e.g., the Internet).
- **Adaptation Layer:** A software component or specification that maps UOMCS protocol requirements to the specific characteristics and services of an underlying non-UWB bearer technology.
