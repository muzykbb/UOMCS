# UOMCS - Operational Considerations and General Protocol Features

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies system-wide parameters and operational features essential for robust and interoperable UOMCS implementations.

## 2. Protocol Versioning

The `UOMCS_Protocol_Version` field (`uint8_t`) is split into a 4-bit Major Version and a 4-bit Minor Version. Nodes with different Major Versions are incompatible. Nodes with the same Major Version **SHOULD** interoperate at the lowest common Minor Version.

## 3. Node Capabilities Exchange

The `Capabilities_Bitmask` field (`uint16_t`) in `BEACON` frames advertises supported features.

| Bit | Name                         | Description                                            |
|-----|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 0   | `CAP_MESH_FORWARDING`        | Willing to act as a mesh router.                       |
| 1   | `CAP_IP_GATEWAY`             | Is an IP Gateway Node.                                 |
| 2   | `CAP_IP_TRANSPORT`           | Supports IP packet transport.                          |
| 3   | `CAP_BLOCKCHAIN_INTEGRATION` | Supports blockchain messaging.                         |
| 4   | `CAP_HIGH_POWER`             | Not severely battery constrained.                      |
| 5   | `CAP_HELLO_MESSAGES`         | Uses optional `HELLO` messages for link sensing.       |
| 6   | `CAP_SECURE_ROUTING`         | Supports signed routing packets.                       |
| 7-15| `Reserved`                   | Reserved for future use.                               |

## 4. Standardized Error Codes (Informative)
A list of recommended error codes (e.g., `E_HANDSHAKE_TIMEOUT`, `E_ROUTE_NOT_FOUND`) is provided for standardized diagnostics and application feedback.

## 5. Power Management Considerations

Implementations **SHOULD** conserve power via strategies like adaptive beaconing frequency and allowing low-battery nodes to opt-out of mesh forwarding by clearing the `CAP_MESH_FORWARDING` bit in their beacons.

## 6. Network Scalability and Parameter Tuning

Network performance depends on factors like `RREQ` overhead, routing table size, and gateway congestion. The default timeout and TTL values in `03-mesh-networking.md` are starting points and **MAY** be tuned for specific network conditions.

## 7. Interoperability and Profiles

- A **UOMCS Base Profile** is defined by all non-optional features (`00-05`, `08-09`). Implementations **MUST** support this.
- Advanced features are defined as **Optional Profiles** (IP Transport, Blockchain Messaging, etc.), indicated by the `Capabilities_Bitmask`.
